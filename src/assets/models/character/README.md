# Character Models

The 3D character models and animations have been moved to the `/public/models/character/` directory.

This is the standard location for static assets that should be served directly by the web server.

Please look in that directory for the following files:
- character.glb
- idle.glb
- walk.glb
- jump.glb

## Requirements

The character model should be in GLB format.
