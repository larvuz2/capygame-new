# Character Model

Place your character model file here as `character.glb`.

## Requirements

- The model should be in GLB format
- The model should be rigged with a skeleton
- The model should have a neutral pose that's compatible with the animations
- The model should be facing forward (typically along the z-axis)
- The model should be centered at the origin (0,0,0)

## Notes

The model will be automatically attached to the physics capsule and will inherit its movement and rotation.
